# h5
### A mini, modular javascript library for building mobile (and small desktop) apps.

## Goals
h5 aims to be a mini javascript library that can be used to build mobile and small desktop apps targetted towards latest browsers. Although h5 also provides extensions and a way to make it work with older browsers upto IE6.

## Features
- The familiar '$', also available as 'h5' globally.
- A small core h5.js
- An 'extension' API to plug in new extensions to h5, via $.extension(...).
- A way to plug-in a different selector engine. Uses document.querySelectorAll by default.
- An few basic extensions (dom, event, events-for-ie, xhr, touch support)
